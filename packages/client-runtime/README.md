# Client Runtime

Shared client behavior for web and mobile. Public APIs are organized by package
subpath. The package intentionally has no root export.

## Public subpaths

| Subpath          | Responsibility                                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent-steps`    | Agent turn presentation: prompts, folded steps, answers, requests |
| `authorization`  | Bearer and DPoP authorization plus token persistence contracts    |
| `connection`     | Targets, catalog, supervision, retries, registry, and onboarding  |
| `environment`    | Environment identity, descriptors, endpoints, and scoped keys     |
| `errors`         | Shared client error inspection                                    |
| `platform`       | Platform capability and persistence service contracts             |
| `relay`          | Managed relay API and environment discovery                       |
| `rpc`            | HTTP/RPC clients, protocol, sessions, and subscriptions           |
| `state/<domain>` | Focused shared state, retention, reducers, and Atom constructors  |

## Dependency direction

Platform applications provide `platform` services. `connection` composes those
capabilities with `authorization`, `relay`, and `rpc` to supervise environment
sessions. Independent `state` modules consume the connection registry and expose
focused state or Atom constructors to application-owned runtimes.

Applications should import the narrowest relevant subpath. There is no broad
`state` export: use domain paths such as `state/server`, `state/agent`,
or `state/calendar`. Subpath indices and explicitly exported domain
files are public API boundaries; all other files remain implementation details.
